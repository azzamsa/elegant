# My Hacks

- use `LANDINGSITE` value if it's exists in brand URL. This is useful if we have
  separate landing page site.
- `Favorite` metadata key. This will append `FAVOURITE_SYMBOL` before article
  title in home, categories, tags, and archives page.
- Add custom css style for 'Stay in Touch' icons
